2) I want the "how it works" section  to be similar to :
http://firma-sys.pl/
https://www.palmettoorganics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/How-It-Works-Infographic2.jpg

but it should have this blackboard style

3) in the section "Our products" i would like to divide the page into categories (symbol/image + Name), after klicking on it, it should show a list of products of this category with its prices.

4)"Order" button.

5)in "how it works" add dashed line arrows

!!! 6) I couldn't push it to github, I used the "pages" branch, but it's not the same

7) w section "how it works" i struggle to get the div extend to the size of all stuff inside of it. It somehow works with "table"

8) figure out, how does it works with the "products", that it covers the whole inhalt

9) add border to images in how-it-works

CHANGES:
1)  add a class in contact and then for all of the p's do the float:left thing.
